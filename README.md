## The program will start with asking which article the user wants for this run:

### (There are 3 articles available)


## If the user gave the wrong input, the program will keep asking until the user gives a valid input:

### (The input must be an integer within a certain range)

## Then it will ask the user which type of comparison he wants the program to perform. If the user chooses to compare two algorithms, the program will ask which two algorithms he wants to compare.

(The user chose the compare merge sort and quick sort)

## And then the user got to choose to see the first or the last 50 elements in the sorted array.

### (First 50 elements in the array. They are all a. Notice they are mixed with lower and upper cases, which shows that the comparison between strings is not case sensitive.)

## Then the last 50 elements:

### (Last 50 elements in the array)

## After this, the comparison table will be printed as follows:

### (The screenshot shows that the runtime for quick sort and merge sort is similar, which matches their similar efficiency in big O notation.)

## And then the program will ask if the user wants to choose another two to compare. If yes, the program will ask the user for another two algorithms and perform the same operation as above. If no, it will jump out of the loop and ask if the user wants to start over from the beginning. The test case of option 1 (compare the performance of one algorithm on different data size)

### (The screenshot shows the time for the 3 different data sizes and 5 run times in total. It will ask the user if he wants to the beginning and the end as well. The longest one (20000) will be used.)
